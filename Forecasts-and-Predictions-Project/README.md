<br>The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.
In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles. This project includes an analysis of customer profiles and create a customer retention strategy.</br>

<ins> Description of the Data:</ins>
<br>The dataset includes the following fields:
<br><b>'Churn'</b> — the fact of churn for the month in question</br>
<br><i>Current dataset fields:</i>
<br><b>User data for the preceding month</b>
<br><b>'gender'</b>
<br><b>'Near_Location'</b> — whether the user lives or works in the neighborhood where the gym is located
<br><b>'Partner'</b> — whether the user is an employee of a partner company (the gym has partner companies whose employees get discounts; in those cases the gym stores information on customers' employers)
<br><b>Promo_friends</b> — whether the user originally signed up through a "bring a friend" offer (they used a friend's promo code when paying for their first membership)
<br><b>'Phone'</b> — whether the user provided their phone number
<br><b>'Age'</b>
<br><b>'Lifetime'</b> — the time (in months) since the customer first came to the gym</br>
<br><i>Data from the log of visits and purchases and data on current membership status</i>
<br><b>'Contract_period'</b> — 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year
<br><b>'Month_to_end_contract'</b> — the months remaining until the contract expires
<br><b>'Group_visits'</b> — whether the user takes part in group sessions
<br><b>'Avg_class_frequency_total'</b> — average frequency of visits per week over the customer's lifetime
<br><b>'Avg_class_frequency_current_month'</b> — average frequency of visits per week over the preceding month
<br><b>'Avg_additional_charges_total'</b> — the total amount of money spent on other gym services: cafe, athletic goods, cosmetics, massages, etc.


<ins>Project Goal:</ins>
<br>Learn to predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer
<br>Draw up typical user portraits: select the most outstanding groups and describe their main features
<br>Analyze the factors that impact churn most
<br>Draw basic conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service:
<br>Identify target groups
<br>Suggest measures to cut churn
<br>Describe any other patterns you see with respect to interaction with customers
