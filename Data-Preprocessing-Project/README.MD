<ins>Project Description:</ins>
<br>This project includes an anlysis of customer’s marital status and number of children and whether these parameters have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. In this project I used the bank's data on customers’ credit worthiness.</br>


<ins>Description of the data:</ins>
<br><b>children:</b> the number of children in the family</br>
<br><b>days_employed:</b> how long the customer has been working</br>
<br><b>dob_years:</b> the customer’s age</br>
<br><b>education:</b> the customer’s education level</br>
<br><b>education_id:</b> identifier for the customer’s education</br>
<br><b>family_status:</b> the customer’s marital status</br>
<br><b>family_status_id:</b> identifier for the customer’s marital status</br>

<br><b>purpose:</b> reason for taking out a loan</br>

<ins>Project Goal:</ins>
<br>Generate a report that will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.</br>
